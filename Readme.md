# Pong! - A Pygame Project
I've always been interested in gaming, so what better place to start in my game development career than Pong?
This project was developed using Pygame, and the music was composed by myself.
To record it, I used "Magical 8Bit Plug 2", a free plugin that simulates 8-bit sound.

### How to Run It
If pygame isn't installed:
```pip install pygame```

To run the game itself:
```python3 main.py```

### To-do
- __Refactor code__: Most of my program is in main.py, and I'm aware I didn't use OOP at full extent. Since the basic idea of this project was to learn Pygame, I didn't worry too much about code organization, although I do see how that could've been improved.
- __Fix Bug (?)__: there's a bug in which the ball gets stuck on the player/rival's block. I may have fixed it, but it's something hard to replicate, so I'll keep this problem in mind while playing it and I'll try to fix it whenever I can replicate it well.
- __Create Windows .exe__
